# WhatsThatApp

This is my submission for the MMU Mobile Development unit in 2022/23, a React-Native "WhatsApp" clone.

The backend is located here https://github.com/ash-williams/WhatsThat

My repo is located at https://github.com/jrstrts/WhatsThatApp

## Code Style
I used the [Google JS Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html), enforced by ESLint in VSCode. I picked this because it seemed more sane to me out of the box than the Airbnb style guide.

An example of me using it comes when validating props (for example seen [here](https://github.com/jrstrts/WhatsThatApp/blob/3e90b8166f6a61e705eca77f0f1cac0c9de6337c/components/elements/message.js#L6-L9) in the Message component). 

## Commits
At some point through the early stages of coding I've forgotten to regularly commit. I broke the changes down as best I could before [this commit (3e90b81)](https://github.com/jrstrts/WhatsThatApp/commit/3e90b8166f6a61e705eca77f0f1cac0c9de6337c) but those commits aren't ideal, especially the linked commit which batch adds all of the navigation structure. All commits after this one are broken down more appropriately.
