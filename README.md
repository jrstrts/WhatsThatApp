# WhatsThatApp

This is my submission for the MMU Mobile Development unit in 2022/23, a React-Native "WhatsApp" clone.

The backend is located here https://github.com/ash-williams/WhatsThat

## Code Style
I used the [Google JS Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html), enforced by ESLint in VSCode. I picked this because it seemed more sane to me out of the box than the Airbnb style guide.

An example of me using it comes when validating props (for example seen in the Message component).
